    With a Ph.D. in Sustainable Energy and extensive experience in energy consulting, ESG strategy development, and sustainability analysis, I bring strong technical expertise to market analysis roles. My background spans both academic and commercial settings, where I have contributed to innovative projects such as the FRONTSH1P Horizon project and optimized ESG strategies by evaluating impacts, risks, and opportunities. I have developed a deep understanding of green fuels through my research in the Bioenergy and Biofuels lab. Additionally, as a sustainability consultant, I gained in-depth knowledge of European energy regulations, sustainability trends, and the drivers of renewable energy markets. This is complemented by robust data analysis skills and expertise in stakeholder engagement, particularly through the application of double materiality principles. Furthermore, my experience in information security management has broadened my perspective, enabling me to recognize the interconnectedness of various knowledge fields. I am seeking a role that leverages my diverse skill set and innovative thinking to accelerate the energy transition while ensuring cybersecurity and data privacy are maintained.
